KASLR for Freescale BookE
=========================

The word KASLR stands for Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization.

This document tries to explain the implementation of the KASLR for
Freescale BookE. KASLR is a security feature that deters exploit
attempts relying on knowledge of the location of kernel internals.

KASLR for Freescale BookE32
-------------------------

Since CONFIG_RELOCATABLE has already supported, what we need to do is
map or copy kernel to a proper place and relocate. Freescale Book-E
parts expect lowmem to be mapped by fixed TLB entries(TLB1). The TLB1
entries are not suitable to map the kernel directly in a randomized
region, so we chose to copy the kernel to a proper place and restart to
relocate.

Entropy is derived from the banner and timer base, which will change every
build and boot. This not so much safe so additionally the bootloader may
pass entropy via the /chosen/kaslr-seed node in device tree.

We will use the first 512M of the low memory to randomize the kernel
image. The memory will be split in 64M zones. We will use the lower 8
bit of the entropy to decide the index of the 64M zone. Then we chose a
16K aligned offset inside the 64M zone to put the kernel in::

    KERNELBASE

        |-->   64M   <--|
        |               |
        +---------------+    +----------------+---------------+
        |               |....|    |kernel|    |               |
        +---------------+    +----------------+---------------+
        |                         |
        |----->   offset    <-----|

                              kernstart_virt_addr


KASLR for Freescale BookE64
---------------------------

The implementation for Freescale BookE64 is similar to BookE32. One
difference is that Freescale BookE64 set up a TLB mapping of 1G during
booting. Another difference is that ppc64 needs the kernel to be
64K-aligned. So we can randomize the kernel in this 1G mapping and make
it 64K-aligned. This can save some code to creat another TLB map at early
boot. The disadvantage is that we only have about 1G/64K = 16384 slots to
put the kernel in::

    KERNELBASE

          64K                     |--> kernel <--|
           |                      |              |
        +--+--+--+    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+    +--+--+
        |  |  |  |....|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |....|  |  |
        +--+--+--+    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+    +--+--+
        |                         |                        1G
        |----->   offset    <-----|

                              kernstart_virt_addr

To enable KASLR, set CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE = y. If KASLR is enable and you
want to disable it at runtime, add "nokaslr" to the kernel cmdline.
