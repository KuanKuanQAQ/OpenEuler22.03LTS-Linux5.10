	default y
	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Netswift NICs. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

config TXGBE
	tristate "Netswift PCI-Express 10Gigabit Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	imply PTP_1588_CLOCK
	help
	  This driver supports Netswift 10gigabit ethernet adapters.
	  For more information on how to identify your adapter, go
	  to <http://www.net-swift.com>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called txgbe.

	  Say Y if you want to expose thermal sensor data on these devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

config TXGBE_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Netswift PCI-Express 10Gigabit adapters debugfs support"
	default n
	depends on TXGBE
	help
	  Say Y if you want to setup debugfs for these devices.

config TXGBE_POLL_LINK_STATUS
	bool "Netswift PCI-Express 10Gigabit adapters poll mode support"
	default n
	depends on TXGBE
	help
	  Say Y if you want to turn these devices to poll mode instead of interrupt-trigged TX/RX.

	  If unsure, say N.
config TXGBE_SYSFS
	bool "Netswift PCI-Express 10Gigabit adapters sysfs support"
